# LoRa Mesh

LoRa has opened up a realm of possibilities for Internet of Things and 
transmission of digital signals across long ranges. What's missing in
the LoRa ecosystem is a meshing protocol that can handle Layer 2 and Layer
3 in the OSI networking model, allowing advanced data transfer using TCP and
other ubiquitous protocols. LoRa Mesh is the solution.

## Roadmap

- [x] LoStik interface
- [x] Local network tunnel
- [ ] Message protocol
- [ ] Node discovery
- [ ] Gateway DHCP
- [ ] Multi-hop routing (spanning tree?)
- [ ] Support multiple LoRa devices
